*Exploring Digital Footprints: Analyzing Instagram Engagement*
Hello! I primarily turn to Instagram as a tool to help me wake up and become more alert. Curious about whether this habit holds true, I decided to analyze my engagement patterns on the platform to understand the specific times when I actively use Instagram to when I seek to shake off sleepiness and increase my alertness.  So, this project helped me to effectively utilize data processing and visualization techniques to provide insights into my social media behavior, particularly focusing on the patterns of likes and comments across different times and contexts. The analyses ranged from daily and hourly patterns to content analysis in comments, offering a comprehensive view of my engagement on social media. The social media tool I used is Instagram. With that, I downloaded my private data to analyze my engagements.
I've used: 
 EDA was a fundamental part of my project, employed to uncover insights about my social media habits.
Python: Main programming language for data processing and analysis.
JSON: Data format used for storing the social media activity.
Matplotlib: Python library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Used for processing and analyzing text data in comments.
My method of understanding the usage of social media with the help of  Exploratory Data Analysis was  the :
 *1.Likes Analysis by Day and Time*
Weekly Pattern: Determined the distribution of likes across different days of the week.
6-Hour Interval Analysis: Categorized likes into four 6-hour intervals to pinpoint peak activity times within a day.
Hourly Distribution: Analyzed the frequency of likes for each hour to gain insight into hourly engagement patterns.
*2. Comment Analysis*
Comment Content: Employed Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify frequently used words in comments.
Media Owner Analysis: Determined the frequency of comments made on different media owners' posts.
Hourly Comments Pattern: Analyzed the timestamps of comments to understand my active hours for commenting.
*3. Combined Analysis of Likes and Comments*
I merged the hourly data of both likes and comments for a comparative study of engagement patterns.
*Conclusion*
The analysis provided deep insights into my social media usage, revealing patterns and trends that could be leveraged for optimizing online engagement strategies. This project demonstrates the power of data analytics in understanding digital behavior, offering valuable insights for both individuals and businesses. I can use these data to minimize the time I spend on Instagram and turn it into effective self-improvement time which aligns my engagement times with my sleep schedule since I found out and proved that I use Instagram most frequently when I wake up. Looks like the first thing I do in the morning is not wash my face! It is scrolling on Instagram. >
*### What next?*
I am planning to conduct an in-depth analysis of my social media engagement, specifically focusing on Instagram usage. My goal is to compare this with my daily physical activity and the specific locations where I tend to use Instagram. To achieve this, I intend to utilize data from my location and movement history. This approach will help me understand not only when and where I use Instagram most frequently, but also what motivates me to engage with the platform in these contexts. Additionally, I will investigate what activities I typically engage in after using social media, to gain a comprehensive understanding of its impact on my daily routine and behavior.
